"What is it?", Marie starts, "Waht is it you've got?"
"I know why we're stuck"
"Really? Well, what could be the reason?"
"The reason...", you stand up and point to Haru, "Is you, Haru"
"W-what? Me? What would give you that idea?", Haru stammers
"Check out the riddle. it spells out 'It's H-A-R-U'"
"Come on, guys! There's no way I could have started the time loop-!" Haru quickly covers her mouth
"We never mentioned that there was a time loop... so it must have been you!"
Everyone stares at Haru, when suddenly she starts laughing
"So, you finally figured it out", Haru laughs, "I must say that I'm quite impressed"
"So, why did you trap me here? and who are Player and Itsu?", you ask
"I trapped you here to feed off of your life energy, they are aspects of you that I broke off"
You start to say something but Itsu cuts you off
"Then I guess it's time to return to you, Hero"
"What do you mean, where are you going? I'm no hero! What are you talking about?"
Itsu and Player start to glow, fuse together, then disppear
"HAHAH!" Haru booms, "It's far too late for you! I wanted to play around, but it looks like I'll have to kill you here"
She starts to dance around the room, then she throws a wild punch at you.
You instinctively dodge it.
Then, you start to remember.
