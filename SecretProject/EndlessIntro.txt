You wake up in your bed in your village
"Hey sleepyhead, you better wake up soon!", you hear a girl yell from downstairs
You decide on whether or not to get out of bed, but you decide to get up and eat breakfast
"Look who finally got up.", the girl teases, "Your food's nearly cold"
"Oh quit teasing me, Itsu. Is Marie up yet?", you ask
"Yeah, I'm here", Marie fades into the chair next to you
You feel an odd sense of déjà vu as you eat with your housemates, but you brush it off
Suddenly, you get the feeling that someone is going to call you
"Could someone get that?"
"Sure.", you groan"
"Meet us at the usual place. If you're late, Penalty!", a voice from the phone yells"
"Who was it?", Itsu asks
"Hurry up and finish eating, Haru wants us to meet up at the usual place. Late means a penalty.
The three of you finish eating and head out to the meeting place, where you see an unfamiliar face
"You're late!", Haru yells at you.
"Yeah, yeah. So, who's the new face?", you ask, motioning towards the stranger
"I don't know their real name, but they ask to be called 'The Player'. I'm just going along with it"
You try to get a good look at the player. You can't determine their gender, but you can discern a look of annoyance.
"Well, let's be off!"
