As you deliver the final blow to the demonic priestess, she lets out an ear-piercing shriek
As she screams, her body begins to glow with increasing brightness
Suddenly, the light flickers and dies, the screaming stops, and her body falls limp to the floor
The other priestesses rush in and pick her up as your are hurried out of the room, and barred entry.
Days pass
You are notified that Her Ladyship wishes to see you
As you enter the inner sanctum, you are greeted by a beautiful maiden
"Welcome to my sanctum. I must thank you for freeing me from that horrendous curse", the maiden praises you
"Oh it was no problem, your Ladyship", you bashfully reply
"Oh please, call me Amane"
"Okay enough with the small talk, lets cut to the chase", Marie injects
"Still the same as ever, eh Marie", Amane glares
"Still the same old me. Look, this kid here is gonna need the Divine Blessing and a free ticket to Hell"
"I suppose I could grant you these things as a reward for saving not only me but all of my subordinates from the curse of corruption"
"Thanks a bunch, Nene"
"I thought I told you to never call me that", Amane sighs, "Very well. I shall grant you the blessing"
Right after she says this your body starts to tingle as a warm light envelopes you. A short while later, you black out
You awaken back on the grounds of the temple
