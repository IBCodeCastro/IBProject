"Well, I guess this is it", you say to Marie
"Yeah. This is the final battle. After this the world will be freed from the Demon King's evil ways", she responds
"Any final words of encouragment before I go off to fight?"
"Don't die?"
"Gee thanks"
You push open the doors with a loud creak
"I've been waiting for you", a voice booms across the room
You see the source of the voice: A giant black and red demon with an evil-looking black sword
"You're the Demon King, I assume", you reply
"Why, yes I am. I take it you've come to try to defeat me?"
"I'm going to do more than try, I'm going to succeed"
The Demon King laughs. "It's going to take a lot more than bravado to kill me."
"I'm going to kill you and take back my friend!"
"We shall see about that. I'm thinking I'll turn the two of you into my eternal slaves!"
You yell out a triumphant battle cry and charge at the Demon King
"It seems like you're eager to die! Very well! I will grant you your death wish"
The two of you clash swords, and the battle begins"
