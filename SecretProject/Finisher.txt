As you deal the final blow, the Demon King drops his sword and reels back
"That'll teach you not to mess with me or the world!", you shout triumphantly
"You think this will do me in?", the Demon King yells, "I have yet to release my true power!"
Just then, the entire castle starts shaking
You turn to look at the Demon King to see that he is being engulfed in shadows, and getting larger by the second
"BEHOLD! MY TRUE POWER!"
When thr transformation finishes, the Demon King has become a giant demon the size of the castle
"So, what are we supposed to do now? There's no way I can defeat him like this!"
"Then there's only one thing I can do. I'm going to use all of my power and imbue you with it", says Marie
"But what'll happen to you?"
"Don't worry about me. Just get that sword!"
You do as she says, and return to her
"Thanks for showing me around the world. Before all of this, I wasn't even allowed outside of the palace"
"Palace? What are you-"
Marie cuts you off with a kiss
"Good luck"
With that, Marie fades away and you start glowing
"You bastard!", you shout, "I'll kill you for making her do that! And for kidnapping my friend! Why did you even do that anyway?"
"TO LURE YOU TO ME. YOU HAVE THE POWERS OF A GOD, WHICH I WILL THOROUGHLY ENJOY SLOWLY DRAINING FROM YOU"
"This is it! I'm going to take you down right now!"
"HA! PUNY MORTAL! I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY! I'M GOING TO BEAT YOU WITHIN AN INCH OF YOUR LIFE!"
With that, the final battle starts.
