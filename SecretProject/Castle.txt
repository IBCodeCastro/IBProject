"Well, without my power helping you, you'd be obliterated within seconds of nearing Him"
"Fine, I guess I really have no choice then, do I?"
"Not really, no. Just let me bite your hand and the contract will be sealed"
"Wait, why do you have to bite m-OW!", you scream as Marie chomps on your hand
"Once she lets go, a mark appears on your hand, but everything fades out as you start to lose consciousness
"Probably should have warned you about that. Oh well. Congratulations, hero. You..signed...deal....with..."
Having trouble hearing Marie's words, you finally drift into unconsciousness
You wake up in a town's inn, with Marie sitting beside you
"So you finally woke up? I had no idea that it affected the contractee so much");
"You've probably got a lot of questions, and I will answer them in time. But first, we need the Minotaur's Horn"
"And you want me to go get it? Did signing that contract get me any new powers?", you inquire
"Yes, and yes. Try focusing hard and swinging your weapon"
You do that, and find that your sword swings almost at the speed of light and into a nearby vase, but it doesn't shatter
You try again to break it, and on your third swing the vase shatters into a billion pieces
"That's an enchant that reduces damage but increases the chance of hitting a weak point", Marie informs you
"So, lets go get that horn"
**********You've gained the ability "Swift Strike"**********
