"What's that got to do with anything?"
"Well, where do you think that someone REALLY evil would hide out?"
"...um...Hell?"
"Correct! Without more divinergy protecting you, wour soul would have been ripped from your body"
"And that would be very bad"
"Yes. You would have died, but more importantly I'd be down one soul!"
"Gee thanks for worrying about me"
"Anytime. Anyway, that blessing has tethered your soul to both me and your body, so you'll survive."
"Did I get any upgrades or powers?"
"Oh yeah. That blessing also granted you luscious hair and sparkly eyes, increasing your Charm by 2"
"Ha ha. Very funny."
"Anyway, we're going to a rebel demon village, and are going to work our way to the castle"
