As you turn to leave the village, you are stopped by the village elder
"Hero", he says, "I must thank you for freeing our village from its opression and misery"
"You're welcome, it wasn't all that big of a deal", you say humbly
"As a way of saying thanks, we have some information for you before you go", he says as he motions to someone
"Good day, hero", the person greets you as they walk towards you, "My name is Kachishi, and I am a spy for the rebels"
"Nice to meet you, Kachishi. Gonna have to skip some pleasantries as I am on a tight schedule"
"Then I shall make things quick. In order to defeat the Demon Lord, you'll need to obtain the 12 Aberrant Blades"
"Another fetch quest? Kill me now"
"No, I do believe that 11 of them should be found within the Demon Lord's castle"
"Only 11? What about the twelfth?"
"We managed to steal one of them while he was away conquering part of the overworld"
Kachishi motions towards a trunk that was hidden away in the corner
"Open it, you're gonna need it more than we are"
You open the trunk, and you gaze upon its contents in wonder. Inside of the trunk appears to be a straight katana
