"So what can I do to escape the loop"
"Isn't that just the million dollar question? Truth is, we don't have any idea!", exclaims Itsu
"What!? Then what do we do now?"
"Keep doing anything we can that's different and see if it works"
"Cool. Good talk, now I'm going to go to sleep and think things over"
You walk away from Itsu and return to your house and fall into a fitful sleep
