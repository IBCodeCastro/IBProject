You sit in the diner with your group, Itsu and yourself looking forlorn
"What's with thong faces you two?", Haru asks cheerfully
"We can't figure something out", you respond
"There's a riddle we found but can't figure out what the answer is", Itsu say
"Wait, what riddle? you never mentioned anything about a riddle"
"I found it recently"
"Mind if I see the riddle?", Haru asks as she snatches the piece of paper out of Itsu's hand
You glance over at the paper in Haru's hands
*********************
It's like **** on your wedding ***
Hell hath nothing like **
Ask *** ye shall recieve
Repetition **********
Under an **** spell
*********************
"This doesn't even make any sense! What's the question to solve?", Haru exlcaims
"Why does it look like certain parts of the riddle are crossed out?"
"That's what we cant figure out. Why does such a thing exist?", Itsu explains
"Huh. Well, let's sleep on it. Maybe we'll figure something out tomorrow. Your thoughts, Player?"
Player just nods and gets up to leave, and Haru follows them out
Suddenly you get a feeling, something like if you don't stop her, you'll be doomed to repeat
Your body is racked with pain, and you watch helplessly as she leaves the diner.
You sigh, pay the tab, go home, and fall asleep
