You awlk over to the altar to investigate it
"It says here that you need to place the baldes onto it", Marie discovers
"Well then we should start out with The Absolute Sword, Zutto Kanna or whatever", you reply
You place the sword onto the altar, when suddenly a bright flash of light blinds you!
"Gah! What's happening!?", you cry out
"I'm not too sure but keep your eyes closed!"
The bright light soon begins to fade, and the sword has disappeared from the altar
"So we just lost one of the swords. Great."
"Hold on, look at the wall"
You turn to look at the wall and see that one of the indentations is glowing with the sword inside of it
"What's up with this one?", you ask
"I think that the goal of this room is to colect all of the swords and get them into the wall"
"Any idea what is gonna happen when do?"
"No, but it's our only option so we might as well try it out"
